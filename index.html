<p>ComSSA is the Computer Science Students Association at Curtin University, 
operating out of Curtin's Bentley campus, in Perth, Western Australia. ComSSA 
is located on the ground floor of the Engineering Pavilion, building 215. Our
office is also located in this building, in room 215.104.

<p>Membership is open to everyone, and it's free if you have a Guild voucher, 
which can be found in the annual student diary, or $10 otherwise.

<p>We run social events, provide academic materials and assistance for Department
of Computing units, and have a good time hacking away at interesting projects, be
they hardware, software or otherwise.

<p>Members also have access to Microsoft Windows licenses free of charge through
DreamSpark Premium, and discounts from our sponsors, including Tokyo Underground,
Quality Comics and Tactics.

<p>You can register in person at our club room at any time. During orientation days,
you can also find us outside the Guild, building 106. For any other enquiries, or
just to have a chat, contact us:
