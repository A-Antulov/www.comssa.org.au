<p>ComSSA is located on the second floor of the New Technologies building at
Curtin University, just off Wark Avenue, in room 314.238.

<p>Membership is open to everyone, and it's free if you have a Guild voucher,
which can be found in the annual student diary, or $10 otherwise.

<p>We run social events, provide academic materials and assistance for
Department of Computing units, and have a good time hacking away at interesting
projects, be they hardware, software or otherwise.

<p>Members also have access to Microsoft Windows licenses free of charge
through DreamSpark Premium, and discounts from our sponsors, including Tokyo
Underground, Quality Comics and Tactics.

<p>You can register in person at our club room at any time. During orientation
days, you can also find us outside the Guild, building 106. For any other
enquiries, or just to have a chat, contact us:
