<p>ComSSA is located on the second floor of the New Technologies building of
Curtin University just off Wark Avenue, room 314.238.

<p>Membership is open to everyone, and it's free if you have a Curtin Student
Guild voucher, which can be found in the annual student diary, or $10 otherwise.

<p>We run social events, provide academic materials and assistance for
Department of Computing courses, and generally have a good time hacking away at
interesting projects.

<p>Members also have access to Microsoft licenses free of charge through
DreamSpark Premium, and discounts from our sponsors, including <a

href="http://www.tactics.net.au">Tactics</a> and more.

<p>You can register in person at our club room at any time. During <a
href="http://students.curtin.edu.au/administration/dates/">orientation weeks</a
>, you can also find us outside the Guild, building 106.
