title: Joining ComSSA
---

<p>To get the most out of ComSSA, you'll want to become an official
member. You'll get a membership card, which'll entitle you to a range
of discounts with our sponsors, and you'll be given automatic access
to special member pricing for our events.

<p>To see what a ComSSA membership will get you, see our <a href="/services">
services</a> page.

<p>You can join ComSSA by providing us with either $10, or a Curtin Student Guild club
membership voucher.

<p>Interested in joining? Here's how!

<a name="IRL"><h2>Talk to a committee member</h2></a>
If you find yourself in the Engineering Pavilion, you can talk to any of our
committee members, who'll be happy to sign you up. If you want to sign up with
a Curtin Student Guild club membership voucher, you'll have to use this signup method.

If you don't know where to find a committee member, you can <a href="mailto:club@comssa.org.au">
email the committee</A> to set up a time.


<a name="online"><h2>Online</h2></a>
<p>If you'd prefer to sign up online, we have an online portal that'll allow you to do so. Unfortunately,
you cannot use Curtin Student Guild club membership vouchers to sign up online.

<p>To get started, go to <a href="https://comssa.tidyclub.com/memberships/">our signup page</a>. You'll be asked
for your Curtin Student Guild membership status, please use this to notify us if you are a Guild member. Please
do not mark yourself as paying with a voucher, this will <b>not</b> lessen any online memberships fees.
