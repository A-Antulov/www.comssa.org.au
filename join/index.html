title: Joining ComSSA
---

<p>To get the most out of ComSSA, you'll want to become an official
member. You'll get a membership card, which'll entitle you to a range
of discounts with our sponsors, and you'll be given automatic access
to special member pricing for our events.

<p>To see what a ComSSA membership will get you, see our <a href="/services">
services</a> page.

<p>You can join ComSSA by providing us with either $10, or a Curtin Student Guild club
membership voucher.

<p>Interested in joining? Here's how!

<h2>Talk to a committee member</h2>
If you find yourself in the Engineering Pavilion, you can talk to any of our
committee members, who'll be happy to sign you up. If you want to sign up with
a Curtin Student Guild club membership voucher, you'll have to use this signup method.

If you don't know where to find a committee member, you can <a href="mailto:club@comssa.org.au">
email the committee</A> to set up a time.


<h2>Online</h2>
If you'd prefer to sign up online, we're currently in the process of building a system
that'll enable you to do so. You'll be able to pay with credit card or PayPal, but there
will be 79c processing fee for online payments. Unfortunately, you cannot use Curtin Student
Guild club membership vouchers to sign up online.
