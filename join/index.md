To get the most out of ComSSA, you'll want to become an official member. You'll
receive a membership sticker to place on your Curtin ID card, which will entitle
you to a range of discounts with our [sponsors], access to our [services], as
well as special member pricing for our [events].

You can become a member of ComSSA with either $10 or a Curtin Student Guild club
membership voucher. Interested in joining? Here's how!

## Talk to a committee member

If you find yourself in the Engineering Pavilion or the New Technologies
building, see one of our friendly [committee members][about], who will be happy
to sign you up. This method is required if you are using a club membership
voucher.

Can't find a committee member? [Email the committee][email] to set up a time!

## Online

If you'd prefer to sign up online, that's even easier! Unfortunately, you can't
use club membership vouchers to sign up online.

To get started, head over to our [registration page][tidy]. You'll be asked for
your Curtin Student Guild membership status, so please use this to let us know
if you are a Guild member. Please do not mark yourself as paying with a voucher
â€” this will *not* lessen any online membership fees.
