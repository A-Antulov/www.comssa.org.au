To get the most out of ComSSA, you'll want to become an official member. You'll
receive a membership sticker to place on your Curtin ID card, which will entitle
you to a range of discounts with our [sponsors], access to our [services], as
well as special member pricing for our [events].

You can become a member of ComSSA for $5 if you're a Curtin Guild Member or for free with a Curtin Student Guild club
membership voucher. Interested in joining? Here's how!

## In-Person

Talk to a committee member around building 314 at Curtin and we'll be happy to sign you up. If you're not sure who we are, have a look at the posters on the noticeboards. This method is required if you are using a club membership
voucher.

Can't find a committee member? [Email the committee][email] to set up a time!

## Online

If you'd prefer to sign up online, that's even easier! Unfortunately, you can't use club membership vouchers to sign up online.

To get started, head over to our [registration page][tidy]. You'll be asked for
your Curtin Student Guild membership status, so please use this to let us know
if you are a Guild member. Please do not mark yourself as paying with a voucher
â€” this will *not* lessen any online membership fees.
