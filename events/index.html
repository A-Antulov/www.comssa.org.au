<h2>LANs</h2>

<p><i>Every tuition free week and semester break</i>

<p>ComSSA's premier event occurs at least six times a year, with each LAN
lasting five days. If that isn't quite enough, the Wintereenmas special LAN
in January runs for at least seven days. More details in the <a href="lan">LAN
FAQ</a>.

<h2>Games nights</h2>

<p><i>6:00pm, every fortnight on Wednesday</i>

<p>With any console you can imagine from the Atari ST to the Xbox 360, plus
some Dreamcast and Nintendo 64 in between, there's no shortage of amusement,
nor a scarcity of anger if Mario Party is your thing.

<h2>Quiz night</h2>

<p><i>Late October every year</i>

<p>Prepare yourself to be confounded by the most ridiculous, trivial and inane
questions while under the influence at the <a href=

Bottle of custard included.

<h2>The AGM</h2>

<p><i>Around October every year</i>

<p>While unlike the other events, if there's one day of the year you can be on
campus, it's the annual general meeting. Here you can shape the future of ComSSA
by electing the new executive committee, or volunteer to be a potential <abbr
title="ordinary commitee member">OCM</abbr> for the next year.

<h2>Committee meetings</h2>

<p><i>6:00pm, every fortnight on Wednesday</i>

<p>If you're keen on getting involved with the committee, you'll be a lot more
prepared if you also attend our club's meetings. This is your best chance to
make your voice heard regarding matters of the club, big or small.
