<h2>The AGM</h2>

<p><i>Around October every year</i>

<p>While unlike the other events, if there's one day of the year you can be on
campus, it's the annual general meeting. Here you can shape the future of ComSSA
by electing the new executive committee, or volunteer to be a potential <abbr
title="ordinary commitee member">OCM</abbr> for the next year.

<p>If you're keen on getting involved with the committee, you'll be a lot more
prepared if you attend the fortnightly meetings at 6:00pm on Wednesdays. This
is your chance to make your voice heard regarding everyday matters of the club.
