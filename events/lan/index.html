title: LAN frequently asked questions
---

<h2>Basic</h2>

<h3>When does the LAN nominally start and end?</h3>

<p>Generally starts on a Saturday morning, and runs until the Tuesday (always
at the committee’s discretion). Typically it’s Tuesday as that is often the
last day where there are enough people left to help pack up. If you're around
on the last day, try to give a hand packing up if possible.

<h3>When do the vast bulk of players leave?</h3>

<p>Most people leave Sunday evening (if they have work during the week) or the
Monday/Tuesday otherwise. Saturday night is most often the peak.

<h3>What are the most popular games played?</h3>

<p><i>Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</i>, <i>Call of Duty 4</i>, <i>The
Ship</i> and <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> are consistently popular, as well as a
variety of MOBAs. Popular games will often have tournaments for novelty prizes.
Owning your games legitimately is strongly recommended.

<p>Build up a healthy Steam library, join the ComSSA group and see the trends,
the games people play are always changing. While there are a few staples, it's
your LAN as much as anyone else's, so make it how you want it to be!

<h3>What is the price, and when should I pay?</h3>

<p>Currently $5 for members, $10 otherwise. Wintereenmas is usually more expensive, as it runs for a 7-9 days rather than 4-5 days. There aren't any
tickets; committee walk around every now and then during the LAN taking
payments and writing down names on a list.

<h3>How much area is each player allocated?</h3>

<p>Each attendee is allocated half a desk, allowing for 31 places on the desks.
We can fit more by bringing in an extra desk or two, and after that people
overflow onto the couches.

<h2>Stuff</h2>

<h3>What should players bring?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Computer (monitor, mouse, keyboard, headphones, power cords, etc.)
	<li>One power board (we provide one power socket, so you'll need a
	    four-socket board)
	<li>Money (entry price, plus enough to buy food over the weekend)
	<ul>
		<li>The library is open on weekdays
		<li>The Karawara shops (Waterford Plaza) are open on weekends
	</ul>
	<li>Sleeping gear (sleeping bag, pillow, air mattresses are fine, if
	    not too big)
	<ul>
		<li>Couches are available but get taken quickly</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Showering gear (towel, soap, shampoo, showering thongs)
	<ul>
		<li>There is a shower near the toilets on level 4 of 314</li>
	</ul>
	<li>A network cable (about 5 metres in length should suffice)
</ul>

<p>You should also bring spare power cables, network cables and a keydrive.
Having a car is also extremely useful.

<h3>What shouldn’t players bring?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Speakers
	<li>Contraband (drugs, alcohol, etc.)
	<li>Unusual network setups (Internet Connection Sharing, DHCP servers,
	    bridged connections)
	<li>Multiple monitors (seriously, you won't be able to fit them)
</ul>

<h3>Can I bring a secondary computer, laptop or server?</h3>

<p>Only if you pay for a second spot. At the committee's prior discretion, an
exception may be made for file servers with a large amount of content, but do
not expect this to always be the case.

<h3>Can I turn up on Friday to help and/or leave my stuff?</h3>

<p>We'd rather if you didn't, because it makes setting up more difficult. We
may make an exception if you have absolutely no transport on Saturday, but
please confirm with the committee first.

<h2>Transport</h2>

<h3>Is there an elevator from ground level or only stairs?</h3>

<p>Yes, but this isn't an issue. Use the ramp from the back of the building.

<h3>How do I get to the LAN?</h3>

<p>From Manning Road, turn into Townsing Drive, the southern entry of Curtin
University. Turn right at the roundabout onto Brand Drive, and turn left into
the second carpark after Wark Avenue. This carpark is perfect for loading your
computer with our provided trolley.

<h2>Tech</h2>

<h3>What regions are covered by each power phase?</h3>

<p>The two closest to the orange wall are blue phase. The one in the pool table
corner runs off the red phase in the kitchen. The kitchen corner runs off the
white phase next to the office door.

<h3>What is the maximum load on each phase?</h3>

<p>Generally not an issue, with the looms as a limit on the phases. As long as
the four clusters are spread across the three phases, they shouldn't be
overloaded.

<h3>Is an overload easily recoverable during the LAN?</h3>

<p>No, and especially not on weekends or national public holidays. Once a phase
is gone, don't expect it to come back. Never use the kettle and toaster
simultaneously.

<h3>Do players have Internet access?</h3>

<p>You can connect to Curtin’s wireless network if you have an account.
Usually, this is the only way to get internet, people at the LAN can help you
sort out your metric settings so you can be on the LAN and get internet off the
wireless at the same time.

<h3>How do I connect to the LAN and the wireless simultaneously?</h3>

<p>Configure your network adapter metrics such that the wireless has a smaller
number (higher priority) than the LAN. Use pairs of values such as 5 and 10, or
10 and 20.

<h3>What is the torrenting policy?</h3>

<p>Don’t torrent. Make sure that any clients are exited before you move your
computer.

<h3>What else should I prepare?</h3>

<p>Make sure you have the latest version of <a href=
"http://strongdc.sourceforge.net">StrongDC++</a> installed, and all of your
files hashed <i>before</i> the LAN starts. LanDC++ is not permitted. Also
ensure that your firewall is enabled, your malware definitions are updated, and
all of your Steam games are installed and up to date.

<h2>Personal</h2>

<h3>What is the alcohol policy?</h3>

<p>Don’t bring alcohol into the room, or consume within. It is an unlicensed
public venue and thus is subject to street drinking laws — ComSSA may be liable
for any fines incurred.

<h3>Where can players sleep?</h3>

<p>In the common room, or at home. Don’t sleep in your car or in other rooms.
Couches are available, and the club has some mattresses from old couches in the
office that they can bring out. These get taken quickly, and there are no
‘dibs’ on couches.

<h3>What facilities are available for hygiene (sinks, showers, etc.)?</h3>

<p>Showers upstairs on level 4, each level has an identical toilet block
layout, the shower is where the disabled toilet would be if it were on level 2.
You can feel free to use any of the toilets on level 2, 3 or 4. There is also a
sink in the club room. Don't pee in the sink!

<h3>What are the best sources of food (convenience, price, etc.)?</h3>

<p>Karawara shops, between IGA and Coles you can normally get a good deal.
Group orders for pizza frequently occur and are often cheap.
