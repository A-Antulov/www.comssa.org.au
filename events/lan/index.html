title: LAN frequently asked questions
---

<h2>Basic</h2>

<h3>When does the LAN nominally start and end?</h3>

<p>This changes every time, depending on how long the university will give us
rooms for. We generally start on a Friday night, and run until Monday (always
at the committee’s discretion). Typically it’s Monday as that is often the
last day where there are enough people left to help pack up. If you're around
on the last day, try to give a hand packing up if possible.

<p>Again, to be sure, see the information provided with the promotional material
for the individual event, or contact the committee if you're confused.

<h3>When do the vast bulk of players leave?</h3>

<p>Most people leave Sunday evening (if they have work during the week) or the
Monday otherwise. Saturday night is most often the peak.

<h3>What are the most popular games played?</h3>

<p><i>Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne</i>, <i>Call of Duty 4</i>, <i>The
Ship</i> and <i>Halo: Combat Evolved</i> are consistently popular, as well as a
variety of MOBAs. Popular games will often have tournaments for novelty prizes.
Owning your games legitimately is strongly recommended.

<p>Build up a healthy Steam library, join the ComSSA group and see the trends,
the games people play are always changing. While there are a few staples, it's
your LAN as much as anyone else's, so make it how you want it to be!

<h3>What is the price, and when should I pay?</h3>

<p>Currently $5 for members, $10 otherwise. Wintereenmas is usually more expensive,
as it runs for a 4-5 days rather than 2-3 days. There aren't any tickets; committee
walk around every now and then during the LAN taking payments and recording names.

<p>If you are unable to pay at the time, you will be invoiced for the ticket.

<h3>How much area is each player allocated?</h3>

<p>Each attendee is allocated either small single-person desk or half of a two-person
desk, depending on the location. Either way, it's big enough for a typical computer
setup.</p>

<h2>Stuff</h2>

<h3>What should players bring?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Computer (monitor, mouse, keyboard, headphones, power cords, etc.)
	<li>One power board (we provide one power socket, so you'll need a power board)
	<li>Money (entry price, plus enough to buy food over the weekend)
	<ul>
		<li>Various on-campus cafes are open on weekdays
		<li>The Karawara shops (Waterford Plaza) are open on weekends
	</ul>
	<li>Sleeping gear (sleeping bag, pillow, air mattresses are fine, if
	    not too big)
	<li>Showering gear (towel, soap, shampoo, showering thongs)
	<li>A network cable (about 5 metres in length should suffice)
</ul>

<p>You should also bring spare power cables, network cables and a USB drive.
Having a car is also extremely useful.

<h3>What shouldn’t players bring?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Speakers
	<li>Contraband (drugs, alcohol, etc.)
	<li>Unusual network setups (Internet Connection Sharing, DHCP servers,
	    bridged connections)
	<li>Multiple monitors (seriously, you won't be able to fit them)
</ul>

<h3>Can I bring a secondary computer, laptop or server?</h3>

<p>Only if you pay for a second spot. At the committee's prior discretion, an
exception may be made for file servers with a large amount of content, but do
not expect this to always be the case.

<h2>Transport</h2>

<h3>Is there an elevator from ground level or only stairs?</h3>

<p>If the LAN is held in building 215, there is an elevator available that'll
get you to all floors.

<p>If the LAN is held in building 314, this isn't an issue. Use the ramp from the
back of the building.

<h3>How do I get to the LAN?</h3>

<p>From Manning Road, turn into Townsing Drive, the southern entry of Curtin
University. Turn right at the roundabout onto Brand Drive, and turn left into
the second carpark after Wark Avenue. This carpark is perfect for loading your
computer with our provided trolley. This is true for LAN held in building 314
and building 215.

<h2>Tech</h2>

<h3>Is an overload easily recoverable during the LAN?</h3>

<p>No, and especially not on weekends or national public holidays. Once a phase
is gone, don't expect it to come back. Never use the kettle and toaster
simultaneously.

<h3>Do players have Internet access?</h3>

<p>You can connect to Curtin’s wireless network if you have an account.
Usually, this is the only way to get internet, people at the LAN can help you
sort out your metric settings so you can be on the LAN and get internet off the
wireless at the same time.

<h3>How do I connect to the LAN and the wireless simultaneously?</h3>

<p>Configure your network adapter metrics such that the wireless has a smaller
number (higher priority) than the LAN. Use pairs of values such as 5 and 10, or
10 and 20.

<h3>What is the torrenting policy?</h3>

<p>Don’t torrent. Make sure that any clients are exited before you move your
computer. You may be terminated from Curtin University if you do not obey
Curtin's ICT policy.

<h3>What else should I prepare?</h3>

<p>Make sure you have the latest version of <a href=
"http://www.airdcpp.net/download">AirDC</a> installed, and all of your
files hashed <i>before</i> the LAN starts. You cannot download AirDC on Curtin's
network. LanDC++ is not permitted. Also ensure that your firewall is enabled,
your malware definitions are updated, and all of your Steam games are installed
and up to date.

<h2>Personal</h2>

<h3>What is the alcohol policy?</h3>

<p>Don’t bring alcohol into the room, or consume within.

<h3>Where can players sleep?</h3>

<p>Depending on the venue, a room may be provided for sleeping. Please ask the
committee on the day, or check the promotional material for the event. Otherwise,
you can sleep in the LAN room, or at home. Don’t sleep in your car or in other rooms.

<p>You will not be provided with blankets, pillows, or mattresses.

<h3>What facilities are available for hygiene (sinks, showers, etc.)?</h3>

<p>Toilets are available on all levels of building 314 (bar the ground floor) and
level 1 of building 215.

<p>Showers are available on level 1 of building 215, and level 4 of building 314. These
showers are for postgraduate/staff use only, but are unlocked.

<p>ComSSA does not condone the misuse of Curtin resources.

<h3>What are the best sources of food (convenience, price, etc.)?</h3>

<p>Karawara shops, between IGA and Coles you can normally get a good deal.
Group orders for pizza frequently occur and are often cheap.
