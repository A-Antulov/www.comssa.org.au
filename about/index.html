<p>Since 2002, ComSSA has been the home and second family to many computing
enthusiasts and students at Curtin University.

<p>Our aim is to foster a thriving community of future and active computing
professionals while providing a place for like-minded members to study, connect
and enjoy university life, as well as representation to the Department of
Computing and the university as a whole.
