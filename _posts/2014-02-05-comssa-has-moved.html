<p>Unfortunately, after over a decade, we have lost access to our clubroom.

<p>Until further notice, we have been relocated to the common area of the
Engineering Pavilion, which is the ground floor of building 215. In the same
building is our office, which is shared with IEEE in room 215.104.

<p>Our pool table has also moved with us, and you can find it in the entrance
to the Pavilion, with games for $1 each. See you there!
