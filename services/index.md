## Microsoft DreamSpark

Microsoft provides computing students with a wide range of software licences for no
charge, including Windows and Visual Studio. ComSSA manages a [DreamSpark
Premium subscription][msdnaa] on behalf of the Department of Computing, so we're
the people to talk to if you want to get your hands on a bunch of *free*
Microsoft software.

[msdnaa]: /services/dreamspark/

## Unix shell accounts

Members are eligible to receive a free shell account on our Linux servers to
run mission-critical applications like <code>cmatrix</code> and
<code>cowsay</code>, send and receive email, and host simple websites. If you
wish to have an account setup, send us an [email][listemail] expressing interest
and we'll get you all set up.
