## Engineering Pavilion access

ComSSA members can use their Curtin ID cards to access the ground floor of the
new Engineering Pavilion in building 215. This building is usually reserved for
engineering and networking students, strangely excluding software engineering.

Any current Curtin student, associate, or staff member who joins ComSSA will be
granted card access, subject to restrictions by the building's caretaker.

## Pool table

Our [pool table][pool] is also available on the ground floor of the Engineering
Pavilion, open to be played on by anyone with a $1 coin.

[pool]: /services/pool/

## Microsoft DreamSpark

Microsoft provides students with a wide range of software licences for no
charge, including Windows and Visual Studio. ComSSA manages a [DreamSpark
Premium subscription][msdnaa] on behalf of the Department of Computing, so we're
the people to talk to if you want to get your hands on a bunch of *free*
Microsoft software.

[msdnaa]: /services/dreamspark/

## Unix shell accounts

Members are eligible to receive a free shell account on our Linux servers to
run mission-critical applications like <code>cmatrix</code> and
<code>cowsay</code>, send and receive email, and host simple websites. If you 
wish to have an account setup, send us an [email][listemail] expressing interest 
and we'll get you all set up.

[listemail]: mailto:club@comssa.org.au

## Unit materials, iLectures, and past exams

Some of our members have archived unit media distributed via Blackboard and
Echo360. Most of these units are in the departments of Computing or Mathematics.
While not all units are available, we're always happy to share what we have with
our members for no charge.

## IRC

ComSSA provides an IRC channel for members to talk to each other in real time!
If you have an IRC client, [join our network][irc]! If you don't, we have a
[web chat service][webirc], as well as [more details][confirc] on how to connect
using your own client if you so desire.
