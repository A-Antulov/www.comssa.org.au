<h2>Engineering Pavilion Access</h2>

<p>As a ComSSA member you get access to the ground floor of the new Engineering Pavilion
in building 215. This building is usually reserved for Bachelor of Engineering students, 
but—if you're a current Curtin student—registering for ComSSA will grant you access to this
building, regardless of your choice of degree.

<p>If you are not doing a BEng degree and you aren't ComSSA member, you will not have access to the
Engineering Pavilion, which is where ComSSA members meet on a daily basis.

<h2>Pool table</h2>

<p>Our pool table is located in the ground floor of the Engineering Pavilion,
open to use by anyone for $1 a game. <a href="pool/">Read more?</a>

<h2>DreamSpark</h2>

<p>DreamSpark is a Microsoft program to provide students a wide range of Microsoft
software (such as Windows and Visual Studio) at no charge. ComSSA manages a DreamSpark
Premium subscription on behalf of the Department of Computing, so we're the people
you'll want to talk to if you want to get your hands on a bunch of <b>free</b>
Microsoft software. <a href="dreamspark/">Read more?</a>

<h2>Shell accounts</h2>

<p>Members are eligible to receive a free shell account on our Linux servers to
run mission-critical applications like <code>cmatrix</code> and <code
>cowsay</code>.

<p>There are no guarantees, nor is there an SLA.

<h2>Email accounts</h2>

<p>Anyone with a shell account also receives a basic email service at <code
>$user@comssa.org.au</code> by Exim with access to <code>mutt</code> and
optional forwarding via the <code>~/.forward</code> file.

<h2>Web hosting</h2>

<p>Static web hosting is available to members with shell accounts, published at
<code>http://users.comssa.org.au/$user</code> for all to
<code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> flame on <code>&lt;/marquee&gt;</code>.

<h2>Unit materials, iLectures and past exams</h2>

<p>Some of our members have archived unit media distributed via Blackboard
and Echo360. Most of these units are in the departments of Computing or
Mathematics. While not all units are available, we're always happy to share
what we have with our members for no profit.

<h2>IRC</h2>

<p>ComSSA provides an IRC channel for ComSSA members to talk to each-other in
real-time! If you have an IRC client, <a href="irc://irc.comssa.org.au/comssa"
>join our network</a>! If you don't, we have <a href="http://irc.comssa.org.au/">
a web chat</a>, and a <a href="/services/irc/">page</a> telling you how to connect
using your own client if you so desire.
