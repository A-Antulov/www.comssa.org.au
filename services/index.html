<h2>Shell accounts</h2>

<p>Members are eligible to receive a free shell account on our Linux servers to
run mission-critical applications like <code>cmatrix</code> and <code
>cowsay</code>.

<p>There are no guarantees, nor is there an SLA.

<h2>Email redirection</h2>

<p>Anyone with a shell account may also choose to redirect mail for <code
>user@comssa.org.au</code> to their personal email address, which is probably
much less professional.

<h2>DreamSpark Premium (formerly MSDNAA)</h2>

<p>We provide license keys for Microsoft software such as Windows and Windows
Server free of charge, as well as physical media for Microsoft software for a
small fee.

<h2>Unit materials, iLectures and past exams</h2>

<p>Some of our members have archived unit media distributed via Blackboard
and Echo360. Most of these units are in the departments of Computing or
Mathematics. While not all units are available, we're always happy to share
what we have with our members for no profit.
