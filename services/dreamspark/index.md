## What is DreamSpark?

DreamSpark is a Microsoft programme which provides students with a wide range
of Microsoft software, such as Windows and Visual Studio, at no charge. ComSSA
manages a DreamSpark Premium subscription on behalf of the Department of
Computing, so we're the people to ask for license keys!

## How can I get license keys?

ComSSA is currently building a new DreamSpark portal to give eligible students
self-serve access to DreamSpark products. Whilst construction is underway, we
ask that you [email the committee][email] and tell us what you're after.

[email]: mailto:club@comssa.org.au

## Am I eligible?

It's very likely that you are. If you're currently studying any course or unit
run by the Department of Computing this semester, then you are eligible for
full access to our suite of DreamSpark software.

## What do I get?

We have a [list of software][list] on our wiki or you can also contact a committee member on the lists.

## Are there any conditions?

Of course!

  * You aren't allowed to sell or give away any software that we give you.
  * You can only claim software from us if you're studying a course under the
    Department of Computing, or are doing a unit run by the Department of
    Computing in the current semester.
  * You're only allowed access to one key for each Microsoft offering, but
    different editions of the same product count as different offerings; for
    instance, you can claim a key for both Windows 7 Professional *and* Windows
    7 Enterprise.
  * You *are* allowed to legally continue using the software after you finish
    your Computing courses and/or units.

These rules are all based on our legal obligations to Microsoft, and we can't
budge on them. Sorry!
