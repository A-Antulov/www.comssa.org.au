<h2>What is DreamSpark?</h2>
<p>DreamSpark is a Microsoft program to provide students a wide range of Microsoft
software (such as Windows and Visual Studio) at no charge. ComSSA manages a DreamSpark
Premium subscription on behalf of the Department of Computing, so we're the people
you'll want to talk to if you want to get your hands on a bunch of <b>free</b>
Microsoft software.


<h2>How?</h2>
<p>ComSSA is currently building a new DreamSpark portal to give eligible students self-serve
access to DreamSpark products. Whilst construction is underway, we ask that you <a href=
"mailto:club@comssa.org.au">email the committee</a> and tell us what you're after.

<h2>Am I eligible?</h2>
It's very likely that you are. If you're studying a degree under the Department of Computing, or
are doing a unit run by the Department of Computing in the current semester, you are eligible for
full access to our suite DreamSpark software.


<h2>What do I get?</h2>
<p>The list of software you get is ever-growing, and is way too big to list here. Your best bet
is to look at the 'DreamSpark Premium' column of the 'DreamSpark and Designer AA' section of <a
href="http://aka.ms/dsproductlist">this spreadsheet</a>.


<h2>Are there conditions?</h2>
<p>Of course!</p>
<ul>
<li>You are not allowed to sell or give away any software we give you.
<li>You can only claim software from us if you're studying a degree under the Department of Computing, 
    or are doing a unit run by the Department of Computing in the current semester.
<li>You're only allowed access to one key for each Microsoft offering, but different editions of the same
    product count as differnet offerings; for instance, you can claim a key for Windows 7 Professional AND
    Windows 7 Ultimate.
<li>You may keep legally using the software after you finish your Computing degree or unit(s).
</ul>
<p>These are all based on our legal obligations to Microsoft, and we cannot budge on them. Sorry.</p>
