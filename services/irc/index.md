## What is IRC?

IRC is a protocol used for real time group chat. ComSSA operates an IRC server
on the [UniIRC network][uniirc], which is where the computing societies at
Perth's four public universities connect and chat! A lot of ComSSA's members use
the IRC channel to communicate with one another, and it's definitely worth
joining.

[uniirc]: https://www.uniirc.com/

## Use our web client

ComSSA provides a web client for people who are new to IRC. It's clean and easy
to use: simply direct your browser to [irc.comssa.org.au][webirc], enter a
nickname of your choice, and type in <code>#ComSSA</code> for the channel.

Be warned, you'll disconnect when you close the browser, so it's a good idea to
use your own client if you plan on visiting often.

## Use your own client

We recommend that you use your own IRC client, as it makes IRC a lot easier to
use, and native IRC clients are a lot more flexible when it comes to
customisation to fit your needs.

If you already have an IRC client set up, here are our server and channel
details:

  * Server: [irc.comssa.org.au][irc]
  * Port: 6697
  * SSL: yes
  * Channel: #ComSSA

IRC clients are available for all popular platforms, and even some of the other
platforms. Here are a few recommendations:

  * Windows: [HexChat][hexchat], [mIRC][mirc], [Quassel IRC][quassel]
  * Mac OS X: [Textual][textual], [Colloquy][colloquy], [Linkinus][linkinus]
  * Linux (GUI): [XChat][xchat], [Quassel IRC][quassel]
  * Linux (CLI): [Irssi][irssi], [WeeChat][weechat]
  * iOS: [Colloquy][colloquym], [Limechat][limechat]
  * Android: [AndroIRC][androirc], [AndChat][andchat]

Once you have a client installed, [use this link][irc] to go straight to the
ComSSA channel. If that doesn't work, use the connection information provided
above to add a new server; if your client doesn't provide a facility to choose
a channel to join, try typing <code>/join #ComSSA</code> into the message box.
