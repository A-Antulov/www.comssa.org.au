<ul>
	<li>Use common sense: banter is welcome, but avoid being a dick.
	<li>Avoid posting personal and/or personally identifiable information of users unless doing so is in accordance with their wishes.</li>
	<li>Refrain from spamming or flooding channels or other users.</li>
	<li>Don’t post illegal content or conduct illegal activity over IRC.</li>
	<li>Don’t initiate denial of service attacks against users or servers.</li>
	<li>Don’t acquire the nicks of other users with the intent of maliciously deceiving, kicking or banning other users on the network.</li>
	<li>Committee members reserve the right to kick and/or ban users if and only if they are suppressing discussion and/or breaking these rules.</li>
	<li>Users who have been banned have the right to appeal by sending email to comssa@lists.curtin.edu.au.</li>
	<li>ComSSA is a member of the UniIRC network. Be conscious of the fact that your conduct may be seen as representative of the club.</li>
