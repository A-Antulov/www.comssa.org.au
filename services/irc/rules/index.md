title: IRC rules
---

  * Use common sense: banter is welcome, but avoid being a dick.
  * Avoid posting personal and/or personally identifiable information of users
    unless doing so is in accordance with their wishes.
  * Refrain from spamming or flooding channels or other users.
  * Don’t post illegal content or conduct illegal activity over IRC.
  * Don’t initiate denial of service attacks against users or servers.
  * Don’t acquire the nicks of other users with the intent of maliciously
    deceiving, kicking or banning other users on the network.
  * Committee members reserve the right to kick and/or ban users if and only if
    they are suppressing discussion and/or breaking these rules.
  * Users who have been banned have the right to appeal by sending email to
    comssa@lists.curtin.edu.au.
  * ComSSA is a member of the UniIRC network. Be conscious of the fact that
    your conduct may be seen as representative of the club.
