<h2>What is IRC?</h2>
<p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. IRC allows for decentralised real-time
group chat. The Internet is populated with IRC networks, which are comprised of
a collection of IRC servers; IRC networks have IRC channels, and you can join
an IRC channel to talk to other people!


<h2>Use our web client</h2>
<p>ComSSA provides a clean and easy-to-use web client for people that are new
to IRC. Simply direct your browser to <a href=
"http://irc.comssa.org.au/?channels=comssa">our web client</a>, and it should
connect to the ComSSA IRC for you. Be warned, you'll disconnect when you close
the browser, so it's a good idea to use your own client if you plan on visiting
often.


<h2>Use your own client</h2>
<p>It is recommended that you use your own IRC client, as it makes IRC a lot
easier to use, and native IRC clients are a lot easier to customise to fit your
needs.


<p>If you already have an IRC client set up, here is our server and channel
information:

<ul>
	<li>Server: <a href="irc://irc.comssa.org.au/comssa">irc.comssa.org.au</a>
	<li>Port: 6667 (default)
	<li>Channel: #ComSSA
</ul>


<p>IRC clients are available on all popular platforms, and even some of the
not-so-popular ones. Here are a few recommendations:
