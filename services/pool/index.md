## Enter the pool table

The pool table was a wise purchase made by a ComSSA committee over a decade ago.
While it used to reside in the old ComSSA common room, it has since been moved
to the first floor of the Engineering Pavilion, where it's used non-stop by
ComSSA members and engineering casuals alike.

## Where is it?

The pool table is currently located on the first floor of the Engineering
Pavilion, which is coincidentally where ComSSA resides. It's not like it's hard
to miss — enter the door across from the [Basement Café][basement], to the left
of the outdoor ping-pong table, and it'll be staring you in the face.

## How much?

Get this, one dollar per game! Not two dollars, not three dollars, but one
dollar! Half the price of every other pool table (that we know of) on campus!
How cool is that?

## Are you buying more cues?

More often than we'd like but, hey...
