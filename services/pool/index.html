title: The Pool Table

<h2>Enter The Pool Table</h2>
<p>The pool table was a wise purchase, made by a ComSSA committee almost a decade ago.
The pool table used to reside in the old ComSSA clubroom, but has since been moved to
the first floor of the Engineering Pavilion, where it's used non-stop by ComSSA members
and engineering casuals alike.

<h2>Where is it?</h2>
<p>The pool table is currently located on the first floor of the Engineering Pavilion, which
is coincidentally where ComSSA resides. It's not like it's hard to miss, enter the door
across from <a href="http://guild.curtin.edu.au/Common/ContentWM.aspx?CID=69">Basement</a>, to
the left-hand side of the outdoor ping-pong table, and it'll be staring you in the face.

<h2>How much?</h2>
<p>Get this, one dollar per game! Not two dollars, not three dollars, but one dollar! Half the
price of every other pool table (that we know of) on campus! How cool is that!?

<h2>Are you buying more cues?</h2>
<p>Maybe.</p>
