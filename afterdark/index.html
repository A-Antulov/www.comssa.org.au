title: Scitech After Dark
---

<p>Ever wanted to get drunk in a ball pit? ComSSA's got you covered. ComSSA is going to Scitech
After Dark and it's going to be <em>amazeballs</em>.

<p>Scitech After Dark is probably the single best thing Scitech does, they close off the doors to
juvies, serve reasonably priced alcohol, and let you run wild for a few hours. What could possibly
go wrong?

<p>The theme is 'crazy inventors'. You might want to make a note of that when choosing what to wear...

<p>If you want more information, check out the official Scitech page <a href="http://www.scitech.org.au/featured/1572-scitech-after-dark-5-april">here</a>

<p>You should come, it's going to be fun and it's a weekend so you'd just be playing hat sim anyway.

<p>This is an 18+ event.

<p>Drink responsibly.

<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Saturday, April 5at 6:00pm - 10:00pm.

<p>The 10pm finish is a hard finish by Scitech. Sorry.

<h2>Where?</h2>
Scitech, duh. <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/J5XXa">Here's a map</a>.

<h2>Ticketing</h2>
<p>Pricing is $10 for members, $14 for non-members.

<p>You can pay by seeing any committee member on the ground floor of the Engineering Pavilion
(you'll usually find us in the area near the pool table and the kitchen).

<p>If you can't find us, <a href="mailto:club@comssa.org.au">send us an email</a> and we'll sort
something out.
